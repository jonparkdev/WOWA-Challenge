# WOWA-Challenge-2
The goal for this challenge is to test your attention to detail, along with testing your ability to work on an open-ended project.

## Task
https://wowa.ca/calculators/first-time-buyer outlines details about various first-time homebuyer programs across Canada. Using this link we want you to build a single page application that will help **Ontarions** figure out what they are eligible for as a first-time home buyer.  To emphasize, **we do not want you to copy/replicate the page**. To put more concisely, imagine you work for company **X** and they want you to research and create a tool that calculates all the incentives a citizen of Ontario is eligible to receive as a first-time home buyer. That is your task.  

## Objective
- Application must be coded using NextJS and Typescript
- Application must be hosted
  - We should be able to visit the finish product at http://*IP*or*URL* to checkout website
  - Where you host the web app is up to you
- Design and user experience is open-ended.  The only requirement is that results are correct and informative

## Code 
I have provided a base Next.JS setup with the following features:
- Prettier + ESLint code formatting
- Integrated Typescript
- Integrated TailwindCSS

You should extend it, putting your pages in /pages and other components in /src
